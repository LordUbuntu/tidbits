# A web crawler to explore and graph social connections on GitHub from
#   a given user page for a specified graph depth, run in parallel
#   for faster performance.
# The start of a larger project that will get it's own repo once I figure
#   out a better name for it and have more time.

# Features:
# - command line utility
# - specify depth and other features to explore relational graphs
# - visualize graphs
# - parallelism for fast performance
# - basic API interaction with GitHub to be easy to use and change
