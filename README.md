# TidBits

If programming were doodling...

## Description

This repository is my personal wilderness of code.

By that I mean that this repository contains:

* Micro projects.
* Random and spontaneous snippets and ideas.
* Code recreations and salvages from at least 2017.
* Programming experiments.
* And more.

This repository acts like a doodle page of programming. For programs that aren't big enough for their own repository or that I haven't figured out a better place for yet. This repository is not a complete collection of all the code I've ever written, but it is a great opportunity to see what I've done and peer into my mind. Please, have a browse and enjoy.
Please, have a browse and enjoy!

## Notes

* Each file has a name that should be self-explanatory.
* Each file will have a description of what it is.
* Each file has the potential to gain its own repo.
