# TidBits

If programming were doodling...

## Description

This repository is my personal wilderness of code. It is a repository of programs and other small tidbits of programming that I've done since at least 2017 which I thought were not big enough or complex enough to deserve a seperate repo, and also various random ideas and snippets of code I've done. Exploring will give you a chance to see various toy programs I've written. This place acts as a doodling page of random programming experiments, its like a bargain bin of programming ideas and mini-projects.
Please, have a browse and enjoy!

## Notes

* Each file has a name that should be self explanatory.
* Each file will have a description of what it is.
* Each file has the potential to gain its own repo.
