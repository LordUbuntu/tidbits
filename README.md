# TidBits

## Description

This repository is my personal wilderness of code. It is a repository of random programs and other small tidbits of programming that I've done since at least 2017. Exploring will give you a chance to see the various random things I've done.
Please, have a browse and enjoy!

## Notes

Each file has a name that should be self explanatory.
Each file will have a description of what it is.
Each file is a single self-contained program.
Each file has the potential to gain its own repo.
