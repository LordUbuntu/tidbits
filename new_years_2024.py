# Jacobus Burger (2024->2025)
# This new years program prints ascii simulated fire using a similar
#   principle to the winter snowfall program `snow.py`. Inspired by
#   a desire to come on a year anew like a phoenix (üê¶‚Äçüî•) and
#   "keep that fire alive"
# Next time I could do this with ncurses and have the characters move
#   asyncronously with variant colour and more.
